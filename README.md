# nba_game_prediction_model
First pass at created NBA game winning probabilities for an NBA team
 
I worked on this project to serve as a basic building block for creating a prediction model for NBA games. The attached code will take you from a simple data scrape for model inputs, to cleaning and manipulating data, to finally building a model for predicting game outcomes.

The goal of the project was to go end-to-end with creating a prediction model, with the understanding that much more data and continual updating would be required for more accurate predictions (and therefore more alluring outcomes).
